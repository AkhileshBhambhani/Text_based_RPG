कुमारसंभव (KUMARA-SAMBHAVA):- The Birth of War God

Realms/Factions

1) Kshatriyas (kshuh-tree-yuh): Highly intelligent but cynical species from deccan plains. Capable of greatness!
                                Can forge great weapons and tools, and use opponent's weakness to their advantage.

2) Parvateshwaras (Perva-tehsh-wara): The mountain people, brave warriors from the himalayan mountain ranges: the land of mist and snow.
                      Parvateshwaras are known to be the only species capable of taming dragons!
                      As per old vedic myth, they are dragonborn.

3) Rakshasas(Rakh-sha-sa): The forest dwelling, extremely powerful, a-sura(devil) worshipping species. Counter-force to Kshatriyas
                    and Parvateshwaras

Game starts by you choosing a Faction/Clan/Team

Each team varies in what they bring to the table

1) Kshatriyas are more intelligent, closer to humans overall.
2) Parvateshwaras are brave warriors from himalayan mountain ranges, with great strength and skilled at the art of war!

Rules:
1) This is a turn based game, you go first.
2) You may either attack, defend or may restore health in a turn.
3) If the hero dies, it's Game Over!!
4) The opponent can only attack, being a wild creature. Also due to limitations of noob programmer, living in his mother's basement.
5) Intelligence determines how well you can attack or defend against an opponent.


Once team is chosen, we face off against few challenges and go for a final showdown with the Rakshasa Clan's head!
Historically Kshatriyas and Parvateshwaras have never gotten along but are kind of on the same side fighting against Rakshashas!
